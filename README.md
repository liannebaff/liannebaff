## Hello! I'm Lianne 👋

I'm a Pharmacology graduate transitioning into data analytics from a laboratory-based background. I enjoy cleaning data, creating dashboards and turning complex information into something clear and useful.

**I'm happiest when I'm:**
- producing meaningful work
- summarising complex information clearly
- making sure everything adds up (literally!)
- building reports, visualisations and dashboards
- analysing trends and patterns

*(Basically, if it involves organising, structuring or analysing ... I'm in!)*
